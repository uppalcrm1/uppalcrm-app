-- =====================================================
-- FIX: Allow lead deletion when referenced by contacts
-- =====================================================
--
-- Problem: Cannot delete leads that are referenced by contacts table
-- Error: "Key (id)=(...) is still referenced from table contacts"
--
-- Solution: Find and update the constraint to SET NULL on delete
-- =====================================================
